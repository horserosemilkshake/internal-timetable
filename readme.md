# CityU Internal Time Table Scheduler

## Synopsis
It is often difficult for administrators to manually monitor room availability in mega-facility like museums or school campuses, which sometimes raise disputes from conflicting room booking records. Concerning the difficulty in management, related departments have requested an affordable and unified automation tool for visualizing room availability across the facility utilizing existing hardware and API infrastructures. CityU Internal Time Table is the result of this request.
